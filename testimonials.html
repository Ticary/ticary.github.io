                <p>I discovered both Rutu and Ticary soon after transplanting myself in Bellevue at Voicebox. We had a challenge in the autumn of 2016 that required application of resources that we simply did not have. Choosing a new contractor is never easy. They seldom state their capabilities truthfully, perform as advertised and required, and deliver on time and in budget, especially not on a first project.</p>

                <p>With Ticary and under Dr. Mulkar-Mehta's management all of this was accomplished and more. Not only were our business objectives met, but Ticary went above and beyond: collaborating with us on a detailed statement of work that we were able to present to the client, reporting regularly, engaging daily with my team, and transitioning the work to my team once complete. The work itself was comprised of a series of standard statistical NLP challenges and a decision tree in which to manage them. Her team was more than adequate to the task.</p>

                <p><h3><b>Ticary's POC led to a successful 2-year project with a major retailer. </b></h3>I was very grateful for the effort from Ticary and Rutu in particular.</p>

                <p>Rutu is relentless in the pursuit of
    excellence, is breathtakingly innovative and creative, and is a major contributor to our team in terms of building a truly terrific product. Her expertise in NLP and machine learning is exemplary. Most importantly, she goes the extra distance without being asked, and embodies a strong entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

                <p>Rutu has a rare blend of deep scientific understanding of computational language processing with the strength of applying it to challenging language understanding problems in big data today, especially unstructured data. She has particular strength in designing and leading the development of pragmatic solutions to very challenging text understanding problems.</p>

                <p>The expertise Rutu brings in NLP and machine learning has helped us tremendously. Not only is she deeply knowledgable in the state of the art but she is able to explain and communicate concepts effectively to folks like us who are not experts in the data science. Working with Rutu has been a pleasure and we're always eager to engage her services any chance we get. </p>

                <p>Rutu is an absolute gem in a field that is ironically becoming somewhat crowded with undifferentiated rocks. (There's a joke in here about big data, if only I could find it... :D) </p>

                <p>Rutu is an applied scientist and so thinks, prototypes and expresses herself in code just as eloquently as she does in person. She wants to solve hard problems and deliver solutions. Rutu is refreshingly opinionated about things in her domain and doesn't hesitate to express herself. She's also an excellent communicator. </p>

                <p>I look forward to working with Rutu again in the future.</p>
