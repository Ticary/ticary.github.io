                <p>I discovered both Rutu and Ticary soon after transplanting myself in Bellevue at Voicebox. We had a challenge in the autumn of 2016 that required application of resources that we simply did not have. Choosing a new contractor is never easy. They seldom state their capabilities truthfully, perform as advertised and required, and deliver on time and in budget, especially not on a first project.</p>

                <p>With Ticary and under Dr. Mulkar-Mehta's management all of this was accomplished and more. Not only were our business objectives met, but <h3><b>Ticary went above and beyond:</b></h3> collaborating with us on a detailed statement of work that we were able to present to the client, reporting regularly, engaging daily with my team, and transitioning the work to my team once complete. The work itself was comprised of a series of standard statistical NLP challenges and a decision tree in which to manage them. Her team was more than adequate to the task.</p>

                <p><h3><b>Ticary's POC led to a successful 2-year project with a major retailer. </b></h3>I was very grateful for the effort from Ticary and Rutu in particular.</p>

            <p>We engaged Rutu on a multi-phase consulting project to improve the accuracy of machine learning classifiers of textual data, and the experience was great. She was knowledgable, professional, organized, and set and met expectations in terms of budget and timeline. <p>In particular, her <h3><b>practical experience with real-life NLP problems</b></h3> gave her <h3><b>strong intuition in terms of which experiments would likely work</b></h3>, and she used the experimental results to guide her work along the most promising paths.We look forward to working with Rutu again in the future.</p>

                <p>Rutu is an absolute gem in a field that is ironically becoming somewhat crowded with undifferentiated rocks. (There's a joke in here about big data, if only I could find it... :D) </p>

                <p>Rutu is an applied scientist and so thinks, prototypes and <h3 class="secondary-color"><b>expresses herself in code just as eloquently as she does in person </b></h3>. She wants to solve hard problems and deliver solutions. Rutu is refreshingly opinionated about things in her domain and doesn't hesitate to express herself. She's also an excellent communicator. </p>

                <p>Rutu <h3><b>has a wealth of knowledge </b></h3>and has been wonderful to work with! When my company started a tool-development project, we hired Rutu as a consultant. In this role, Rutu carefully listened to our needs, our wants, and our goals, making sure she understood our requirements first and foremost. That meant she was able to quickly give us recommendations that specifically addressed our objectives and focused our efforts. <h3><b>Rutu saved us from spending a lot of time and money on research or concepts that we now know would not have worked.</b></h3> We're grateful for the information and guidance Rutu has shared with us, and appreciate her easy-going and friendly demeanor.</p>
