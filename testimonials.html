                <p>Rutu is an absolute gem in a field that is ironically becoming somewhat crowded with undifferentiated rocks. (There's a joke in here about big data, if only I could find it... :D) </p>

                <p>Rutu is an applied scientist and so thinks, prototypes and expresses herself in code just as eloquently as she does in person. She wants to solve hard problems and deliver solutions. Rutu is refreshingly opinionated about things in her domain and doesn't hesitate to express herself. She's also an excellent communicator. </p>

                <p>I look forward to working with Rutu again in the future.</p>
