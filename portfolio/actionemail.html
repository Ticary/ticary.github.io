                <p>The product, <strong>ActionEmail</strong> was developed to automatically identify emails that required the recipient to respond with a follow up action. This is specifically targeted towards people who have full mailboxes/emails and want to or need to prioritize emails based on the content/requirement of action taken by the recipient. 
                </p>
                <p> Actionable content is anything that requires a focused follow up response, that is different from informational content. In our work we developed machine learning models to discover 5 types of actionable information from email content: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow up with a phone call</li>
                    <li>Follow up with information or advice</li>
                    <li>Follow up with an offline task</li>
                    <li>Follow up with a meeting invite (or data/time information)</li>
                    <li>Follow up with a decision (yes/no)</li>
                </ul>
                 </p>
                
                <p>
                    Imagine if you had a great assistant who can read and organize your email for you. A few things they can do for you: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tell you which email is important, and needs to be addressed first</li>
                        <li>Add labels to any new incoming email, so that you know which category it might belong to. </li>
                        <li>Convert tasks and action items embedded in email into structured actionable items and task lists, and assign them to your calendar - automatically creating due dates for you - so you don’t miss that next important task. </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>

                <p> As a recipient:
As you receive an email from a sender, your assistant will be able to understand and extract pieces of text that are to do lists and tasks, and also extract due dates. This assistant will then keep schedule these tasks and will alert you with reminders so that you don’t have to worry about scheduling and can focus on the more important tasks of working on your action items.
The assistant will also be able to prioritize tasks based on importance, with your help, can allocate the time for you on your calendar. 
As a consequence, you can spend more time working on actionable items, rather than scheduling and prioritizing your tasks. </p>

                <p>As a Sender:
As you send an email to a recipient, where you have outlined tasks and due dates to your collaborations, your assistant will be able to infer that this email content contains action items that are required from the recipient. Your assistant will keep track of all your emails, and will alert you if responses have not been received by the due date. This allows you to focus on other tasks, rather than keeping track of all the action items you need to hear back on. If you do not receive a response by the due date, your assistant will alert you, and also provide you options to remind the recipients if necessary. </p>
