### Why are Data science projects unique?

* with all this data available, it is easy to say - lets just throw an algorithm on the data and and see what we get
* the outcome is more confusion because we have a lot of data to analyse and see if the results are interesting or not
* we need to set up some right strategies and design methodologies that help us structure a sata science problem in a way that is more effective in solving our problem

### What is a design principle?

### Design principles for software engineering

### Asking the right questions for design principles:
* What is the problem?
* What does a solution look like?
* Do humans agree with the solution? - inter rater agreement - proves that the task is well defined
* How is this evaluated
* solve the problem
